# BB_pages

The purpose of this project was to build a dashboard using Plotly.js to explore data on belly button biodiversity. The dashboard includes 3 types of charts to help display the data; a bar chart, gauge chart, and bubble chart. The main objective is to be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in each volunteers belly button when they filter using their "Test Subject ID" number on the dropdown at the top of the page. 

The 3 customizations that the webpage has are
- Add a background color to the body
- Add an image to the jumbotron
- Use a custom font on the jumbotron
